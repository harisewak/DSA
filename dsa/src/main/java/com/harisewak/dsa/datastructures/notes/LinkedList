LinkedList is a data structure which holds a collection of elements in non-contiguous memory locations.
Due to its ability to store elements at non-contiguous locations, adding an element is efficient and takes constant time (O(1))
Able to effectively simulate real world objects e.g. trains

Two types -

1) Singly Linked List : Each element contains a pointer to the next element. The last element points to NULL
2) Doubly Linked List : Each element contains a pointer to both previous and next elements.

Sample implementation -

LinkedList {
    Node head;
    Node tail;
    int size;

    Node<T> {
        T data;
        Node next;

        Node(T data, Node next) {
            this.data = data;
            this.next = next;
        }
    }
}
